<!-- ===== written BEFORE the run (agent) ===== -->

## Hypothesis
lr=7e-4's replicate mean has been unusually stable across n=1-4 (std shrinking
to ~0.0095, well below the ~0.02-0.04 typically seen for lr=6e-4/noise_std
configs). Continuing to n=6 to confirm this is a real, tighter, better basin and
not a temporary run of luck.

## Implementation
No change to `configs/autoencoder.yaml`: lr=7e-4, weight_decay=0.0,
dropout_rate=0.0, noise_std=0.0, patience=50, latent_dimensions=8, seed=0.

<!-- ===== written AFTER the run ===== -->

## Results
<!-- Filled automatically by the driver — leave empty. It writes, for a completed trial:
     per-run metric values (by repeat axis), the aggregated primary metric,
     delta_vs_champion (display only), the also_log means, and the MLflow run ids.
     For a mechanically failed trial it writes the failure reason instead. -->

## Training Dynamics
<!-- Agent, after the run: stability, convergence speed, spikes, plateau, early stopping. -->

## Conclusion
<!-- Agent, after the run: did the hypothesis hold? Mechanistic explanation of why it
     worked or failed — not just the numbers. -->
