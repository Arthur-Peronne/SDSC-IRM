# Trial <id> — <model_name> — <verdict>

<!-- ===== written BEFORE the run (agent) ===== -->

## Hypothesis
Champion replicate series n=5: mean 0.7796, std≈0.0260, already consistent with
dim=60's ~0.03-0.04 noise floor. One more replicate for a slightly rounder n=6
before wrapping this series and writing the final campaign conclusion — no new
hypothesis, pure variance-reduction continuation.

## Implementation
No change to `configs/autoencoder.yaml` — identical to the CHAMPION (02343abb):
lr=6e-4, weight_decay=0.0, dropout_rate=0.0, noise_std=0.0, patience=50,
latent_dimensions=8, seed=0 unchanged.

<!-- ===== written AFTER the run ===== -->

## Results
<!-- Filled automatically by the driver — leave empty. It writes, for a completed trial:
     per-run metric values (by repeat axis), the aggregated primary metric,
     delta_vs_champion (display only), the also_log means, and the MLflow run ids.
     For a mechanically failed trial it writes the failure reason instead. -->

## Training Dynamics
<!-- Agent, after the run: stability, convergence speed, spikes, plateau, early stopping. -->

## Conclusion
<!-- Agent, after the run: did the hypothesis hold? Mechanistic explanation of why it
     worked or failed — not just the numbers. -->
