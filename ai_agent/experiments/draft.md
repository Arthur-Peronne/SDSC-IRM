# Trial <id> — <model_name> — <verdict>

<!-- ===== written BEFORE the run (agent) ===== -->

## Hypothesis
Baseline n=4: mean 0.7806, std≈0.0254, already essentially tied with the
champion's n=6 mean (0.7817). Continuing to n=6 (1 more after this) to finalize
the matched comparison. No new hypothesis on the HP itself.

## Implementation
`configs/autoencoder.yaml`: `noise_std: 0.0001` (baseline's value, unchanged),
lr=6e-4, weight_decay=0.0, dropout_rate=0.0, patience=50, latent_dimensions=8,
seed=0.

<!-- ===== written AFTER the run ===== -->

## Results
<!-- Filled automatically by the driver — leave empty. It writes, for a completed trial:
     per-run metric values (by repeat axis), the aggregated primary metric,
     delta_vs_champion (display only), the also_log means, and the MLflow run ids.
     For a mechanically failed trial it writes the failure reason instead. -->

## Training Dynamics
<!-- Agent, after the run: stability, convergence speed, spikes, plateau, early stopping. -->

## Conclusion
<!-- Agent, after the run: did the hypothesis hold? Mechanistic explanation of why it
     worked or failed — not just the numbers. -->
