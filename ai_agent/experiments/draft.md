# Trial <id> — <model_name> — <verdict>

<!-- ===== written BEFORE the run (agent) ===== -->

## Hypothesis
The new champion bc589070 (patience=50) scored 0.814839, essentially tied with the
old champion's 0.814832 — likely a coincidence given the noise levels seen elsewhere.
A single replicate cannot fully characterize patience=50's variance, but combined
with the very tight patience=45 cluster (std≈0.008) and the wide patience=60 cluster
(std≈0.035), this first replicate will start to indicate whether patience=50 behaves
more like the tight neighbor (45) or the wide one (60), refining the picture of where
the variance transition occurs across the patience range.

## Implementation
No change to configs/autoencoder.yaml — exact champion config (lr=6e-4,
weight_decay=0.0, dropout_rate=0.0, noise_std=0.0001, patience=50). No architecture
change.

<!-- ===== written AFTER the run ===== -->

## Results
<!-- Filled automatically by the driver — leave empty. It writes, for a completed trial:
     per-run metric values (by repeat axis), the aggregated primary metric,
     delta_vs_champion (display only), the also_log means, and the MLflow run ids.
     For a mechanically failed trial it writes the failure reason instead. -->

## Training Dynamics
<!-- Agent, after the run: stability, convergence speed, spikes, plateau, early stopping. -->

## Conclusion
<!-- Agent, after the run: did the hypothesis hold? Mechanistic explanation of why it
     worked or failed — not just the numbers. -->
